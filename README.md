# Welcome to Doodle Chat!

Doodle chat makes your conversations more intentional, more whimsical, and most importantly, more fun! It's a real-time chat application with a twistâ€” the only messages you can send are doodles. It's built with React/Remix, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and a SQLite database hosted with Turso. Deployed on Fly.io.
