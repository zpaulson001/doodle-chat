## Motivation

Life is made better by friends, scribbles, and fewer distractions. Doodle Chat was designed not to hold your attention, but to put a smile on your face as you connect with others.

## Getting Started

If you just want to check out Doodle Chat, you can do so at <https://doodle-chat.fly.dev>. If you'd like to experiment a bit, follow the instructions to get it up and running on your local machine.

Prequisites: You need to have Node.js, npm, and Git installed.

1. First, clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zpaulson001/doodle-chat.git
```

2. Then navigate inside the directory.

```bash
cd doodle-chat
```

3. Next, install the dependencies with npm.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Now copy the contents of ".env.sample" into a new file called ".env".

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

5. Next, use the latest Prisma migration to generate a new sqlite.db file.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

6. Then seed the database with a few sample users.

```bash
npx tsx seed.ts
```

7. If everything's gone smoothly, you can now start the dev server and navigate to the link it provides. Create an account or log in as the demo user. After the first login, you may need to refresh the page to see your profile picture and other sample users. Happy doodling! ðŸ¥³

```bash
npm run dev
```
